        <h3 >My Coding Journey:</h3>
        <p>When I first began my coding journey, it felt like stepping into a whole new world. I was excited yet overwhelmed with all the new information to absorb. My learning path started with Python, and it was a great introduction to programming because of its simplicity and readability. I quickly learned how to work with variables, data types, and basic functions. The beauty of Python, I realized, lies in its versatility—whether it’s for web development, data analysis, or machine learning, Python has a wide range of applications.</p>

    <p>Next, I ventured into HTML and CSS, which allowed me to create and style basic webpages. Learning HTML was like learning the structure of a house—it gave me the framework to build content like headings, paragraphs, and images. CSS, on the other hand, was like interior design for my webpage. I learned how to control the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing, giving my website a visually appealing look.

    <br>Once I felt comfortable with the basics of web design, I dove into JavaScript. Here, I began to see how I could make my websites interactive. I learned how to use JavaScript functions to handle events like button clicks or mouse movements.
Hopping in the near future to be a professional programer.</p>
